### Read me

1 - In root folder (server) install dependencies
2 - cd into client and also install dependencies there
3 - server and client can be run together with the npm package concurrently

### Run the client & server with concurrently

npm run dev

### Run the Express server only

npm run server

### Run the React client only

npm run client

### Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000

## App Info

I chose to take a mobile first approach when think about the layout.

Layout and positioning was done using flexbox.

To handle the API calls data I created a simple NodeJs Express server.

For my get requests and routes, i made use of postman as a means of testing them.

When I had a working route and working request, i created a method on the front end in order to access it.



********* Challenges I faced and how I overcame them *****************
Scope of my approach -

Initially i had a larger idea, but this resulted in scope debt and I realized that I had to scale back.

The DRYness of my code, initially I felt like I was did a lot of repetition ...
