### Read me

1 - In root folder (server) install dependencies
2 - cd into client and also install dependencies there
3 - server and client can be run together with the npm package concurrently

### Run the client & server with concurrently

npm run dev

### Run the Express server only

npm run server

### Run the React client only

npm run client

### Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000

## App Info

I chose to take a mobile first approach when think about the layout.

Layout and positioning was done using flexbox.

To handle the API data I created a simple NodeJs Express server.

For my get requests and routes, i made use of postman as a means of testing them.

When I had a working route and working request, i created a method on the front end in order to access it.
